*Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nano Degree projects.*

In this program, I learnt the techniques that power self-driving cars across the full stack of a vehicleâ€™s autonomous capabilities. Using Deep Learning with radar and lidar sensor fusion, I also trained the vehicle to detect and identify its surroundings to inform navigation. This program is co-authored with **Mercedes Benz** and **Waymo**

## Projects:

- Finding Lane Lines
- Traffic Sign Classifier
- Object detection in urban enviroment
- 3D Object detection
- Sensor Fusion
- Scan Matching Localization
- Motion Planning
- Control and Trajectory tracking for autonomous vehicles
